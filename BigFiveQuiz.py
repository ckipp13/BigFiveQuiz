"""
This Python script is designed to administer the Big Five Personality Test, 
which assesses an individual's scores across five major personality traits: 
Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and Openness. 
The test results are presented visually through graphs and stored in a 
structured format.

The program utilizes several Python libraries including json for loading and 
saving data, pandas for data manipulation, seaborn and matplotlib for data 
visualization. It defines a 'UserProfile' class to manage user data, a 'BigFive'
class to handle the quiz logic, and contains functions for starting the quiz, 
calculating scores, and displaying results.

Key Components:
- UserProfile: Manages user data including name, age, gender, and test scores.
- BigFive: Loads quiz questions, administers the quiz, and handles score updates.
- DisplayGraph and DisplayPie: Methods within UserProfile for visualizing data.
- main: The main function of the script which orchestrates user interactions, 
quiz execution, and result presentation.

The script expects user input for name, age, and gender, validates it, and uses 
this data to create a user profile. The quiz questions are loaded from a JSON 
file and the user answers are processed to calculate personality trait scores. 
Results are saved and displayed graphically.

Usage:
The script is intended to be run directly. User inputs are gathered through 
command-line prompts, 
and the results are both displayed on the terminal and saved to a file.

Requires:
- json to manage quiz question storage and retrieval.
- pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib for data handling and visualization.

        Displays a pie chart showing the distribution of personality traits.

        This method calculates the total scores for each major personality trait

        by summing the values in each respective category within the 'scores' 
        attribute. It then uses these sums to plot a pie chart, visually 
        representing the percentage distribution of each trait within the total.

        The pie chart is formatted with percentages, starts from the top 
        (90 degrees), and maintains a circular aspect ratio to ensure that it is
        displayed as a circle. This visualization helps in understanding the 
        proportion of each personality trait contributing to the profile.

        Uses:
        - `plt.pie` to create the pie chart.
        - `plt.figure` to set the figure size.
        - `plt.title` to add a title to the chart.
        - `plt.axis` to ensure the pie chart is circular.
        - `plt.show` to display the plot.

        Requires:
        - This method assumes that 'self.scores' is a dictionary with keys 
        corresponding to trait names and values as dictionaries whose values can
        be summed (i.e., numeric).
